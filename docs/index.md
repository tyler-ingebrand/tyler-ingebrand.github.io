# Bio

I am a third year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin working with Dr. Ufuk Topcu. I previously received my BS in computer engineering from Iowa State University. My recent research is in reinforcement learning and transfer learning. In particular, I have been applying the logic of Hilbert spaces to machine learning problems, and I have found it to be an excellent approach to achieving transfer in all sorts of problems!
